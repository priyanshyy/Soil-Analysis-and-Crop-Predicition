Soil Analysis and Crop Prediction using Machine Learning ( KRISHI-SUVIDHA )
1. Data Collection :
The ‘Crop Recommendation’ dataset is collected from the Kaggle website. The dataset takes into account 22 different crops :
        1. Nitrogen content ratio (N)
        2. Phosphorus content ratio (P)
        3. Potassium content ratio (K) in the soil
        4. Temperature expressed in degree Celsius
        5. Percentage of Relative Humidity
        6. pH value
        7. Rainfall measured in millimeters.
        
2.Data Processing using Machine Learning and creation of model

3.Purpose :
    * Soil Analysis
    * Crop Prediction
    
    
  SOIL ANALYSIS :
  
  Input--> 
  Here user will enter the values N,P,K content ratio in the soil, 
  temperature expressed in degree Celsius, percentage of Relative Humidity , pH value 
, rainfall measured in millimeters and the crop which the farmer is willing to grow .

Output-->
Our web application shows which crop is the most suitable crop to be grown according to
the soil condition and also the nutrients and other required factors values for the 
particular crop.
